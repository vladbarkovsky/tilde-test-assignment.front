# Introduction

This client app is part of test assignment for Tilde.

# Getting Started

1. Clone `tilde-test-assignment.front` repository. It is important to clone repository in the same directory as the `tilde-test-assignment.api`, since api-client.ts is generated by server to constant path.
1. Install Node.js 20.9.0.
1. Install project dependencies `npm i`.
1. Allow untrusted SSL on localhost in your browser. If you are using Google Chrome, enable chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost and reload browser.
1. I you already launched server, compile client app `npm start`. Application local port is [4200](https://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

All endpoints that you add on server automatically generated by server on launch in Debug configuration. See `api-client.ts` file.

Prettier automatically formats all changes on creating local commits.
